# 3 Day Personal Productivity App Challenge

A simple productivity app idea made in Flutter. It was a challenge with a friend to build a mobile application in three days with zero experience in mobile development or Flutter.

## What is it?

A productivity mobile application based on the idea of doing something for just five minutes, the pomodoro technique, and the 20/20 idea of looking 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes while doing work on a screen.
